# Table

Introducing Table, the successor to Table Mini! This backend helps customers make reservations for a table at a restaurant of their choice.

The **solution** branch contains documented solution code. The commit history of that branch follows the instructions below.

## Getting Started

1. Create a new repository using this one as a template.
2. Configure your `.env` file. Use `table` as the name of the database for this activity.

## Initializing the Database

1. Create the `Restaurant`, `Reservation`, and `Customer` models in the Prisma schema. Refer to the [Prisma docs on many-to-many relations](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/relations/many-to-many-relations).

   - One Restaurant can have many Reservations.
   - There is an _implicit_ many-to-many relation between Reservations and Customers.
     - One Customer can have many Reservations.
     - One Reservation can have many Customers.
   - Reservation is the relation table for the _explicit_ many-to-many relation between Restaurants and Customers.

   ```prisma
    model Restaurant {
      id           Int           @id @default(autoincrement())
      name         String
      reservations Reservation[]
    }

    model Reservation {
      id    Int @id @default(autoincrement())
      date  String

      restaurant   Restaurant @relation(fields: [restaurantId], references: [id])
      restaurantId Int

      party Customer[]
    }

    model Customer {
      id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
      name  String
      email String

      reservations Reservation[]
    }
   ```

   </details>

2. Create the initial migration with `npx prisma migrate dev`.

## Seeding the Database

Write the following code in the `seed` function.

1.  Create 3 restaurants.
    <details>
    <summary>See Solution</summary>

    ```js
    const restaurants = Array.from({ length: numRestaurants }, (_, i) => ({
      name: `Restaurant ${i + 1}`,
    }));
    await prisma.restaurant.createMany({ data: restaurants });
    ```

      </details>

2.  Create 5 customers.

     <details>
     <summary>See Solution</summary>

    ```js
    const customers = Array.from({ length: numCustomers }, (_, i) => ({
      name: `Customer ${i + 1}`,
      email: `customer${i + 1}@foo.bar`,
    }));
    await prisma.customer.createMany({ data: customers });
    ```

       </details>

3.  Read the [Prisma example on connecting a new record to multiple existing records](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/queries/relation-queries#connect-multiple-records).
4.  Create 8 reservations that are each connected to a single restaurant and multiple customers. In each iteration:

    1. Generate a random integer between 1 and 3, inclusive. This will be the number of customers in this reservation.
    2. Create an array of that length. It should be filled with objects. Each object should have an `id` key. The value of that key should be a random customer id.
    3. Create a new reservation with a random restaurant id. Use the array you created to **connect** it to the corresponding customers.
    <details>
       <summary>See Sample Solution</summary>

    ```js
    for (let i = 0; i < numReservations; i++) {
      // Size of party randomly in [1,3]
      const partySize = 1 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);

      // Create array of objects w/ random customer ids
      const party = Array.from({ length: partySize }, () => ({
        id: 1 + Math.floor(Math.random() * numCustomers),
      }));

      // Create a new reservation w/ random id and connect to customers in party
      await prisma.reservation.create({
        data: {
          date: new Date().now().toDateString(),
          restaurantId: 1 + Math.floor(Math.random() * numRestaurants),
          party: { connect: party },
        },
      });
    }
    ```

    </details>

## Adding a Reservation

The API for this activity will only serve one route, so there is no need for a separate router file. In `server.js`, add a handler for `POST /reservations`.

- The request body should include `restaurantId` and `customerIds`, which will be an array of numbers.
- A reservation should be created for the specific restaurant and _connected_ to the specified customers.
- Send the newly created reservation as a response with status 201. This should _include_ the restaurant and customers.

<details>
<summary>See Solution</summary>

```js
const prisma = require("./prisma");
app.post("/reservations", async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const { date, restaurantId, customerIds } = req.body;

    // Converts array of ids into shape needed for `connect`
    const party = customerIds.map((id) => ({ id: +id }));

    const reservation = await prisma.reservation.create({
      data: {
        date,
        restaurantId: +restaurantId,
        party: { connect: party },
      },
      include: {
        restaurant: true,
        party: true,
      },
    });
    res.status(201).json(reservation);
  } catch (e) {
    next(e);
  }
});
```
